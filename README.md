# WorldTravel_Map

"The greatest freedom is to walk alone in the wild." ~ Unknown

This is an interactive world map showing my travel destinations and hiking activities whilst on a gap year after graduation from my master's degree.

After thinking of how to make this gap year memorable in a unique way, I came up with the idea of tracking my physical activities to create an interactive map.

You can zoom in and out and click on location markers to see pictures of the mountain peaks and gorgeous views of my strenuous, but rewarding hikes! 

Have fun exploring :)
